# casterscan-indexer

Currently a fork of [gskril/farcaster-indexer's hubs branch](https://github.com/gskril/farcaster-indexer/tree/hubs), with the addition of a cron job I'm working on
<br/><br/>
In the future I might write a new indexer from scratch if I run into errors or need a new schema, but [Greg's](https://github.com/gskril) indexer has been working really well thus far -- huge shout out to him for all of his work on it.
